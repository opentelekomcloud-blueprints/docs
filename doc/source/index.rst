Blueprints
==========

Users sometimes identify use cases that can be solved in a standardized way to
save research time and effort. Blueprints are a series of best practices,

they are not covered directly by the `Service description
<https://open-telekom-cloud.com/service-description>`_, they are tested and
validated recommendations from our experts.
